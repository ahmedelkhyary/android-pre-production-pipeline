# Android Pre Production Pipeline
An Android pipeline for the CI process is a set of automated steps configured to build your Android application. This pipeline streamlines the development workflow by automatically compiling the app and uploading the final build to Firebase App Distribution.

# Build and Deployment Requirements

1 - To successfully build and upload the app, the following items are required:

2 - Keystore File – Required for signing the Android application.

3 - GitHub Token – Needed if the source code is hosted in a private GitHub repository.

4 - Firebase Credentials – Necessary for uploading the build to Firebase App Distribution.
